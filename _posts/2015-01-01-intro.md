### Overview

Welcome to the 5th edition of the Rust devroom,
co-located with [FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/). FOSDEM is an annual
conference about free and open source software, attended by over 5000
developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world.

The devroom is a colocated conference-within-a-conference that gives us the
opportunity to come together and chat, hack, and share stories about Rust usage
in FLOSS ecosystems.

The devroom will take place on Saturday, 3 February 2024, at
[ULB (Campus Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522), in Brussels, Belgium. Join us to
enjoy a full day of talks, demos and interesting discussions on Rust.
